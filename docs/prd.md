# PRD: Knowledge Graph Agent

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

* PRD: Knowledge Graph Agent
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

The Knowledge Graph Agent is an AI-powered system that automatically indexes GitHub repositories and provides intelligent, context-aware responses about codebases through a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. The agent extracts, processes, and vectorizes code, documentation, and configuration files from specified GitHub repositories, creating a searchable knowledge base that enables users to query complex technical information using natural language.

The system leverages LangChain and LangGraph frameworks to orchestrate document processing workflows, Pinecone for vector storage, and OpenAI models for embeddings and response generation. Users can interact with the agent through REST API endpoints to ask questions about code architecture, implementation details, dependencies, and best practices across indexed repositories.

## 6. Narrative

A developer joins a new team and needs to understand a complex microservices architecture spanning multiple repositories. Instead of spending days reading documentation and exploring code manually, they use the Knowledge Graph Agent to ask specific questions like "How does the authentication service integrate with the user management system?" The agent instantly retrieves relevant code snippets, configuration files, and documentation, providing a comprehensive explanation with direct links to source files. This transforms the onboarding experience from weeks of exploration to hours of focused learning, while ensuring the developer gains accurate, up-to-date insights about the system architecture and implementation patterns.
