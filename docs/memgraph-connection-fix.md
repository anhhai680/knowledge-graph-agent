# MemGraph Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The MemGraph connection issue was caused by several configuration problems:

1. **Docker Network Configuration**: The `memgraph` service was in a separate network, but the `app` service wasn't connected to it
2. **Service Discovery**: The app was trying to connect to `localhost:7687` instead of `memgraph:7687` when running in Docker
3. **Missing Dependencies**: The app service didn't depend on the memgraph service

## Error Details

The original error showed:
```
Failed to connect to MemGraph: Couldn't connect to localhost:7687 (resolved to ('[::1]:7687', '127.0.0.1:7687')):
Failed to establish connection to ResolvedIPv6Address(('::1', 7687, 0, 0)) (reason [Errno 111] Connection refused)
Failed to establish connection to ResolvedIPv4Address(('127.0.0.1', 7687)) (reason [Errno 111] Connection refused)
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Docker Compose Network Configuration
- Added all services to the `knowledge-graph-net` network
- Added `memgraph` as a dependency for the `app` service
- Set `GRAPH_STORE_URL=bolt://memgraph:7687` in the app environment

### 2. Enhanced MemGraph Connection Handling
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Improved error messages and diagnostics
- Added connection timeout configuration
- Better cleanup of failed connections

### 3. Diagnostic Tools
- Created `debug/test_memgraph_connection_clean.py` for testing connectivity
- Added `/api/v1/graph/health` endpoint for connection status
- Added Makefile commands for easy troubleshooting

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages in API endpoints
- Added guidance for Docker vs local development
- Improved logging for connection issues

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Debug Script
```bash
# Test MemGraph connectivity
make test-memgraph

# Or run directly
python debug/test_memgraph_connection_clean.py
```

### Option 2: Using the API Health Check
```bash
# Start services
make docker-up

# Check graph health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/graph/health

# Test the graph info endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/graph/info
```

### Option 3: Check Docker Logs
```bash
# View logs from all services
make docker-logs

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs memgraph
docker-compose logs app
```

## Configuration

The fixed `docker-compose.yml` now includes:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    # ... other config
    environment:
      - GRAPH_STORE_URL=bolt://memgraph:7687  # Uses service name
    depends_on:
      - chroma
      - memgraph  # Added dependency
    networks:
      - knowledge-graph-net  # Added to network

  memgraph:
    image: memgraph/memgraph:2.11.0
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
    networks:
      - knowledge-graph-net

networks:
  knowledge-graph-net:
    driver: bridge
```

## Expected Results

After the fix, the following should work:

1. ✅ MemGraph service starts correctly
2. ✅ App connects to MemGraph using service name
3. ✅ `/api/v1/graph/info` returns connection info
4. ✅ `/api/v1/graph/health` shows healthy status
5. ✅ No connection refused errors in logs

## Troubleshooting

If you still see connection issues:

1. **Verify services are running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. **Check MemGraph logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs memgraph
   ```

3. **Test connectivity**:
   ```bash
   make test-memgraph
   ```

4. **Verify network**:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   docker network inspect knowledge-graph-agent_knowledge-graph-net
   ```

The fix ensures proper Docker networking and service discovery for reliable MemGraph connectivity.
