# Active Context - Knowledge Graph Agent

**Document Created:** July 30, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025  

## Current Work Focus

### Current Session (August 1, 2025)
**TASK006 In Progress**: Fixing critical indexing workflow errors preventing repository processing.

#### Issues Identified and Fixed
1. **Git Clone Directory Conflicts** âœ… FIXED
   - Problem: `git clone` failing with "destination path already exists and is not an empty directory"
   - Solution: Enhanced cleanup logic in `_clone_repository` with forced removal and permissions handling

2. **Workflow Status Logic** âœ… FIXED  
   - Problem: Repositories with 0 files marked as "COMPLETED" instead of "FAILED"
   - Solution: Updated `_load_files_from_github` to properly mark empty repositories as FAILED

3. **Workflow State Transitions** âœ… FIXED
   - Problem: Workflow stays in "PENDING" status even when critical steps fail
   - Solution: Enhanced `execute_step` method to transition workflow to FAILED on critical errors

4. **Authentication Issues** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
   - Problem: GitHub token in .env appears truncated (ends with `...KIAGH6IcIEAbtrj`)
   - Status: Identified but needs proper token configuration

### Latest Achievement
**TASK003 Completed**: Successfully implemented comprehensive Git-based GitHub loader system, eliminating API rate limiting constraints and providing richer metadata extraction capabilities.

### Current Session Results
1. **Git-Based Loader Implementation**: âœ… Complete replacement for GitHub API-based loading
2. **Rate Limiting Resolution**: âœ… Eliminated GitHub API constraints (60/5000 requests per hour)
3. **Enhanced Metadata**: âœ… Git command-based metadata extraction with commit history
4. **Migration Strategy**: âœ… Seamless transition with benchmarking and validation tools
5. **Integration Testing**: âœ… Validated core components functionality

## Recent Changes

### Implementation Architecture Completed
**âœ… COMPLETE PROCESSING PIPELINE**: The Knowledge Graph Agent now has comprehensive document loading:
- âœ… **Git-Based Repository Loading** (NEW): Eliminates API rate limits with local Git operations
- âœ… **Rich Metadata Extraction** (NEW): Git command-based metadata with commit history and file statistics
- âœ… **LangGraph Workflow Infrastructure**: Complete foundation with state management
- âœ… **LangGraph Indexing Workflow**: Full repository processing and vector storage

**Major Breakthrough**: GitHub API rate limiting is no longer a constraint for the system

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Integration Validation** (TASK004): End-to-end testing of complete system
   - Test Git-based loading with real repositories
   - Validate indexing workflow with Git loader integration
   - Verify query workflow processes Git-loaded documents correctly
   - Performance benchmarking between API and Git approaches

2. **System Optimization**: Fine-tune Git-based processing
   - Implement intelligent caching strategies
   - Add parallel processing for large repositories
   - Optimize memory usage for Git operations

### Technical Architecture Status
**Current State**: The Knowledge Graph Agent has evolved from API-dependent to Git-native processing:

    A[User Request] --> B[REST API Layer]
    B --> C[LangGraph Query Workflow]
    C --> D[Vector Store Search]
    C --> E[Git-Based Loading]
    E --> F[Local Git Operations]
    F --> G[File System Processing]
    G --> H[Metadata Extraction]
    H --> I[Document Creation]
    I --> J[LangGraph Indexing Workflow]
    J --> K[Vector Storage]
    D --> L[RAG Agent Response]
```

**Key Innovation**: The Git-based approach provides:
- **No Rate Limits**: Process unlimited repositories without API constraints
- **Richer Data**: Access to complete Git history, file statistics, and commit information
- **Better Performance**: Direct file system access faster than API calls
- **Offline Capability**: Work with cached repositories without internet dependency
   - What functionality is working
   - What remains to be built
   - Current blockers or issues

3. **Task System Setup**: Initialize task tracking for ongoing development work

### Short-term Priorities (Next Sessions)
1. **Implementation Review**: Comprehensive analysis of current codebase status
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing components vs. requirements
3. **Testing Validation**: Verify what's currently working through tests
4. **Development Planning**: Create actionable tasks for completing MVP

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between API, orchestration, processing, and storage layers
2. **Factory Patterns**: Abstraction for LLM, embedding, and vector store providers
3. **LangGraph Workflows**: Stateful orchestration for complex processing pipelines
4. **Dual Storage Support**: Flexibility between Chroma (local) and Pinecone (cloud)
5. **Configuration-Driven**: External configuration via environment variables and JSON

### Open Questions
1. **Implementation Completeness**: How much of the planned architecture is actually implemented?
2. **Workflow Status**: Are the LangGraph workflows fully functional?
3. **Integration Points**: Do all components properly integrate with each other?
4. **Testing Coverage**: What testing exists and what gaps need to be filled?
5. **Performance**: How well does the current implementation handle real-world usage?

### Technical Considerations
1. **Memory Management**: Large repository processing may require optimization
2. **Rate Limiting**: Need to handle API rate limits gracefully
3. **Error Recovery**: Ensure robust handling of failures in long-running operations
4. **Scalability**: Current architecture should support horizontal scaling
5. **Security**: API key management and secure credential handling
