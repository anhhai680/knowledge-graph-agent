# Active Context - Knowledge Graph Agent

**Document Created:** July 30, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025  

## Current Work Focus

### Current Session (August 7, 2025)
**Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved query intent classification issue where all queries were incorrectly returning CODE_SEARCH intent regardless of actual query type.

**Root Cause**: Duplicate QueryIntent enum definitions between API layer (`src/api/models.py`) and workflow layer (`src/workflows/workflow_states.py`) caused mapping conflicts.

**Resolution**: Unified QueryIntent enums by adding missing EXPLANATION and ARCHITECTURE values to API enum, ensuring proper intent classification.

**Impact**: User queries like "Explain how Car endpoint works?" now correctly return EXPLANATION intent instead of defaulting to CODE_SEARCH.
