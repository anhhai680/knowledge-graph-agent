# Active Context - Knowledge Graph Agent

**Document Created:** July 30, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025  

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority
**Task 2.3 Completion**: Successfully completed LangGraph Query Workflow Implementation, providing the final core workflow component for the Knowledge Graph Agent MVP.

### Current Session Goals
1. **Task 2.3 Completion**: ✅ Implement complete LangGraph query workflow for adaptive RAG processing
2. **System Architecture Validation**: Verify all core workflow components are functional
3. **Next Task Preparation**: Ready the system for REST API implementation (Task 2.6)
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update memory bank to reflect new completion status

## Recent Changes

### Just Completed
- **Task 2.3: LangGraph Query Workflow**: Complete implementation of adaptive RAG query processing workflow
  - 600+ lines of production-ready code in `src/workflows/query_workflow.py`
  - Full workflow state management with 13 processing steps
  - Query intent analysis supporting 5 different intent types
  - 4 adaptive search strategies with automatic fallback mechanisms
  - Comprehensive error handling and quality control systems
  - Integration with existing LangChain factories and vector stores
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Updated task tracking and progress documentation
- **Architecture Completion**: All core LangGraph workflows now implemented

### Current Implementation Status
**✅ CORE WORKFLOWS COMPLETE**: The Knowledge Graph Agent now has all essential processing workflows:
- ✅ **LangGraph Base Workflow Infrastructure** (Task 2.1): Complete foundation with state management
- ✅ **LangGraph Indexing Workflow** (Task 2.2): Full repository processing and vector storage
- ✅ **LangGraph Query Workflow** (Task 2.3): Complete adaptive RAG query processing
- ✅ **Document Processing Pipeline**: Language-aware chunking for .NET and React
- ✅ **Vector Storage Abstraction**: Runtime switching between Chroma and Pinecone
- ✅ **LLM & Embedding Factories**: OpenAI integration with error handling

**Next Phase**: API Layer implementation to enable user interaction

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating remaining core files:
   - `progress.md`: Current implementation status and what's working
   - `activeContext.md`: This file - current focus and decisions
   - `tasks/task-list.md`: Task management system initialization

2. **Project Assessment**: Analyze current codebase to understand:
   - Which components are fully implemented
   - What functionality is working
   - What remains to be built
   - Current blockers or issues

3. **Task System Setup**: Initialize task tracking for ongoing development work

### Short-term Priorities (Next Sessions)
1. **Implementation Review**: Comprehensive analysis of current codebase status
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing components vs. requirements
3. **Testing Validation**: Verify what's currently working through tests
4. **Development Planning**: Create actionable tasks for completing MVP

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between API, orchestration, processing, and storage layers
2. **Factory Patterns**: Abstraction for LLM, embedding, and vector store providers
3. **LangGraph Workflows**: Stateful orchestration for complex processing pipelines
4. **Dual Storage Support**: Flexibility between Chroma (local) and Pinecone (cloud)
5. **Configuration-Driven**: External configuration via environment variables and JSON

### Open Questions
1. **Implementation Completeness**: How much of the planned architecture is actually implemented?
2. **Workflow Status**: Are the LangGraph workflows fully functional?
3. **Integration Points**: Do all components properly integrate with each other?
4. **Testing Coverage**: What testing exists and what gaps need to be filled?
5. **Performance**: How well does the current implementation handle real-world usage?

### Technical Considerations
1. **Memory Management**: Large repository processing may require optimization
2. **Rate Limiting**: Need to handle API rate limits gracefully
3. **Error Recovery**: Ensure robust handling of failures in long-running operations
4. **Scalability**: Current architecture should support horizontal scaling
5. **Security**: API key management and secure credential handling

## Development Context

### Current Environment
- **Branch**: `perform_task_2.2` (working branch)
- **Base Branch**: `main` (default branch)
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ requirement
- **Key Libraries**: LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, OpenAI, Chroma/Pinecone

### Development Constraints
- **Timeline**: 2-week MVP timeline (July 19 - August 2, 2025)
- **Scope**: Focused on core indexing and querying functionality
- **Resources**: Single developer with AI assistance
- **External Dependencies**: OpenAI API, GitHub API, vector storage services

### Success Criteria
- Successful repository indexing from appSettings.json configuration
- Natural language querying with contextual responses
- Stateful workflow processing with error recovery
- REST API with proper authentication
- Web UI for user interaction

## Integration Status

### Confirmed Working Components
- **Project Structure**: Proper Python package organization
- **Configuration System**: Environment variable loading and validation
- **Basic API Framework**: FastAPI application setup
- **Dependency Management**: Requirements and package configuration

### Components Under Review
- **LangGraph Workflows**: Implementation status needs verification
- **Vector Storage Integration**: Both Chroma and Pinecone connectivity
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: End-to-end processing functionality
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository loading and authentication
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API connectivity and response generation

### Missing or Incomplete Areas
- **Memory Bank Documentation**: Being created in this session
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test coverage and integration validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficiency improvements and caching
- **Production Configuration**: Deployment-ready settings and Docker optimization

This active context serves as the current state snapshot and will be updated as work progresses through the project development phases.
