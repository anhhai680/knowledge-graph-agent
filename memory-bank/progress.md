### Recent Major Refactoring (August 3, 2025)
**Query Workflow Modular Refactoring Complete**: Successfully completed comprehensive refactoring of the monolithic query workflow into a modular, maintainable architecture:

- **Reduced Complexity**: Cut main query workflow from 1,056 lines to 253 lines (76% reduction)
- **Modular Architecture**: Created 4 specialized handler components (QueryParsingHandler, VectorSearchHandler, ContextProcessingHandler, LLMGenerationHandler)
- **Enhanced Orchestration**: Implemented QueryWorkflowOrchestrator with clean step-by-step processing
- **100% Backward Compatibility**: Maintained all existing interfaces and functionality
