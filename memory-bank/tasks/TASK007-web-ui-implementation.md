# [TASK007] - Web UI Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 2, 2025  
**Updated:** August 2, 2025

## Original Request
Create complete frontend interface for the Knowledge Graph Agent to enable natural language querying and repository management through a user-friendly web interface.

## Thought Process
The Knowledge Graph Agent has achieved complete backend implementation with sophisticated architecture, but lacks a user interface. The current state shows:

1. **Empty Web Directory**: The `web/` folder is completely empty, requiring full frontend implementation
2. **Complete REST API**: All MVP endpoints are implemented with authentication and background processing
3. **Production-Ready Backend**: Full system with Git-based loading, LangGraph workflows, and vector storage
4. **User Experience Gap**: Users currently must interact directly with REST API endpoints

### Requirements Analysis
The web interface needs to provide:
- **Natural Language Query Interface**: Chatbot-style interface for asking questions about repositories
- **Repository Management**: View configured repositories, indexing status, and file counts
- **Workflow Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking for indexing and query workflows
- **Authentication Integration**: Secure access with API key management
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, accessible interface supporting various devices

### Technology Considerations
**Frontend Framework Options**:
1. **React**: Popular, excellent ecosystem, component-based architecture
2. **Vue.js**: Gentle learning curve, excellent documentation, progressive framework
3. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Minimal dependencies, fast loading, direct API integration
4. **Next.js**: React with SSR, excellent for production deployment

**Recommended Approach**: React with modern hooks and TypeScript for type safety and integration with the existing Python/TypeScript ecosystem.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
- **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Development Environment**: Set up build tools, development server, and dependencies
- **Project Structure**: Organize components, services, and utilities
- **API Integration Layer**: Create services for REST API communication
- **Authentication System**: Implement API key management and secure storage

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- **Layout Components**: Header, navigation, main content area, footer
- **Chat Interface**: Message bubbles, input field, conversation history
- **Repository Components**: Repository list, status cards, indexing progress
- **Workflow Monitoring**: Progress bars, status indicators, real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallback states

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation
- **Natural Language Querying**: Chat interface with query submission and response display
- **Repository Management**: View repositories, trigger indexing, monitor progress
- **Workflow Status**: Real-time updates on indexing and query processing
- **Search History**: Previous queries and responses for user reference
- **Settings Interface**: API key configuration and system preferences

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- **API Integration**: Connect all components to existing REST endpoints
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure API key handling and session management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for live workflow status
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across major browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and tablet compatibility

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
- **Build Optimization**: Production build with code splitting and optimization
- **Docker Integration**: Containerize frontend for deployment with backend
- **Environment Configuration**: Production environment variables and settings
- **Documentation**: User guide and deployment instructions
