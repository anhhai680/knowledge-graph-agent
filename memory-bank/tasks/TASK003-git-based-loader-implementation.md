# [TASK003] - Git-Based GitHub Loader Implementation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** August 1, 2025  
**Updated:** August 1, 2025  

## Original Request
You are an expert Python developer, your task is reading the #file:git-based-loader-implementation-plan.md document carefully then perform to implement git-based solution. Any changes must be work correctly as expected.

## Thought Process
The current GitHub loader uses the GitHub API which has significant rate limiting issues (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated users, 5000/hour for authenticated). This severely limits the ability to process large repositories or multiple repositories. The Git-based approach eliminates these limitations by:

1. **Local Repository Operations**: Clone repositories locally and use file system operations instead of API calls
2. **Rich Metadata Extraction**: Use Git commands to extract comprehensive metadata including commit history
3. **Performance Benefits**: Faster file access and no rate limiting constraints
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive recovery strategies for Git operation failures
5. **Migration Strategy**: Seamless migration from API-based to Git-based loading with benchmarking

## Implementation Plan
- ✅ **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** - GitRepositoryManager, GitCommandExecutor, RepositoryUrlHandler
- ✅ **Phase 2: File System Operations** - FileSystemProcessor, GitMetadataExtractor  
- ✅ **Phase 3: Enhanced GitHub Loader** - Main loader class with LangChain BaseLoader interface
- ✅ **Phase 4: Configuration and Integration** - GitSettings, Error handling, Settings integration
- ✅ **Phase 5: Migration and Testing** - LoaderMigrationManager, comprehensive testing
- ⏸️ **Phase 6: Performance Optimization** - Parallel processing, intelligent caching (Future enhancement)
- ⏸️ **Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment** - User guides, deployment updates (Future enhancement)

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
