# [TASK014] - AI Agent for Generic Project Q&A Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 11, 2025  
**Updated:** August 11, 2025  

## Original Request
Create a new implementation to enable the AI Agent to answer generic questions that were mentioned in `generic-project-qa-template.md` document. The implementation should provide all information needed for implementation for generic questions for GitHub Copilot coding agent, outline step-by-step requirements, be well-structured and cleaner, and ensure the output after implementation is completed as expected.

## Thought Process
The current Knowledge Graph Agent excels at answering specific technical questions about indexed codebases but lacks the ability to provide structured responses to common architectural and implementation questions that developers frequently ask about projects. This enhancement bridges the gap between code analysis and business context understanding.

The implementation leverages the existing RAG architecture while introducing new analysis components that can understand project patterns, business domains, API structures, data modeling approaches, and operational concerns. By using configurable templates based on detected architecture patterns, the system can provide comprehensive, standardized answers to generic questions.

Key architectural decisions:
1. **Template-Based Responses**: Use configurable JSON templates for different project types
2. **Multi-Source Analysis**: Combine code analysis, documentation parsing, and configuration inspection  
3. **LangGraph Integration**: Leverage existing workflow infrastructure for consistency
4. **Modular Design**: Create specialized analyzers for different question categories
5. **Caching Strategy**: Cache responses for performance optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Components (Days 1-2)
- **Question Classification System**: Classify questions into 5 predefined categories
- **Architecture Detection Engine**: Detect project architecture patterns from repository structure  
- **Template Engine Foundation**: Generate responses using configurable templates

### Phase 2: Analysis Components (Days 3-4)
- **Business Capability Analyzer**: Analyze business domain and core entities
- **API Endpoint Analyzer**: Parse and document API structure and patterns
- **Data Model Analyzer**: Analyze persistence patterns and data modeling
- **Operational Analyzer**: Analyze deployment, monitoring, and operational patterns

### Phase 3: LangGraph Workflow Integration (Day 5)
- **Generic Q&A Workflow**: Complete LangGraph workflow for processing generic questions
- **Workflow State Management**: Proper state management for question processing

### Phase 4: API Integration (Day 6)
- **REST API Endpoints**: New endpoints for generic Q&A functionality
- **Request/Response Models**: Comprehensive data models for API communication

### Phase 5: Template Configuration (Day 7)
- **Template Structure**: JSON-based template configuration system
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Templates for .NET Clean Architecture, React SPA, Python FastAPI
