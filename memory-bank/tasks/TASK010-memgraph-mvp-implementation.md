# [TASK010] - MemGraph MVP Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 4, 2025  
**Updated:** August 4, 2025  

## Original Request
Implement Phase 1: MVP Implementation from the LangGraph-MemGraph Integration Plan. Create a minimal viable product that integrates MemGraph with the existing Knowledge Graph Agent system using an MVP-first approach with feature flags and backward compatibility.

## Thought Process
This task implements the Phase 1: MVP Implementation outlined in the langgraph-memgraph-integration-plan.md document. The approach focuses on:

1. **MVP-First Strategy**: Start simple, add complexity gradually while preserving existing functionality
2. **Feature Flag Control**: Enable/disable graph features instantly for zero-risk deployment
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Zero impact on existing vector search functionality
4. **Incremental Enhancement**: Foundation for future advanced features

Key technical considerations:
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add `neo4j==5.12.0` driver and potentially `pydantic[email]==2.4.0`
- **Simple Graph Schema**: Basic file-to-file relationships only (File, Class, Method nodes)
- **Docker-based MemGraph Deployment**: MemGraph 2.11.0 container with bolt protocol on port 7687
- **New Module Structure**: Add `src/graphstores/` module with abstract base and MemGraph implementation
- **Feature Flag System**: `ENABLE_GRAPH_FEATURES` flag with runtime switching capability
- **Single API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/graph/query` for basic Cypher query execution
- **Integration with StoreFactory**: Add graph store option to existing factory pattern

The implementation follows the established project patterns while introducing graph capabilities as an optional enhancement to the existing vector search system. **Zero disruption** to existing codebase is ensured through feature flags and optional integration.

    image: memgraph/memgraph:2.11.0
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"  # Bolt protocol
      - "7444:7444"  # HTTP for management

    volumes:
      - memgraph_data:/var/lib/memgraph
    networks:
      - knowledge-graph-net

volumes:
  memgraph_data:
```

### MVP Graph Schema
```cypher
// Simple schema for MVP
CREATE CONSTRAINT file_id_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (f:File) REQUIRE f.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT file_path_unique IF NOT EXISTS FOR (f:File) REQUIRE f.path IS UNIQUE;

// Basic relationships
(:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(:File)
(:File)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(:File)
(:File)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Class)
(:Class)-[:HAS_METHOD]->(:Method)
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Add to .env.example
ENABLE_GRAPH_FEATURES=false
GRAPH_STORE_TYPE=memgraph
GRAPH_STORE_URL=bolt://localhost:7687
GRAPH_STORE_USER=
GRAPH_STORE_PASSWORD=
GRAPH_STORE_DATABASE=memgraph
ENABLE_HYBRID_SEARCH=false
ENABLE_GRAPH_VISUALIZATION=false
```

### Feature Flag Implementation
```python
# settings.py additions
ENABLE_GRAPH_FEATURES: bool = False
GRAPH_STORE_TYPE: str = "memgraph"
GRAPH_STORE_URL: str = "bolt://localhost:7687"
GRAPH_STORE_USER: str = ""
GRAPH_STORE_PASSWORD: str = ""
GRAPH_STORE_DATABASE: str = "memgraph"

# StoreFactory.py integration
def create_store(store_type: str) -> BaseStore:
    if store_type == "graph" and settings.ENABLE_GRAPH_FEATURES:
        return MemGraphStore()
    return VectorStore()  # Default fallback
```

### MVP API Endpoints
```python
# Single MVP endpoint in src/api/routes.py
@router.post("/api/v1/graph/query")
async def execute_graph_query(query: str) -> GraphQueryResponse:
    """Execute Cypher queries against the knowledge graph"""
    if not settings.ENABLE_GRAPH_FEATURES:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Graph features disabled")
    
    try:
        result = graph_store.execute_query(query)
        return GraphQueryResponse(result=result)
    except Exception as e:
