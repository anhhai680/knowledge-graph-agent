# [TASK002] - Query Workflow Implementation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** July 30, 2025  
**Updated:** July 30, 2025  

## Original Request
Complete Task 2.3: LangGraph Query Workflow Implementation from the todo-list.md. Implement a complete stateful query workflow using LangGraph for adaptive RAG query processing with quality control and fallback mechanisms.

## Thought Process
The query workflow is the counterpart to the indexing workflow, handling user queries through an adaptive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) processing pipeline. Key considerations:

1. **State Management**: Following the same patterns as the indexing workflow, using TypedDict schemas and dictionary access
2. **Adaptive Processing**: Implementing query intent analysis, search strategy selection, and response quality control
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies for retrieval and LLM failures
4. **LangChain Integration**: Proper integration with existing vector stores, embeddings, and LLM factories
5. **Quality Control**: Response quality evaluation and retry mechanisms for improved results

## Implementation Plan
- ✅ Create `src/workflows/query_workflow.py` with QueryWorkflow class extending BaseWorkflow
- ✅ Implement query processing steps: Parse → Validate → Analyze Intent → Search → Generate Response
- ✅ Add search strategy determination based on query intent (code search, documentation, debugging, etc.)
- ✅ Implement vector search with metadata filtering and adaptive parameters
- ✅ Add context sufficiency checking and search expansion when needed
- ✅ Integrate LLM calling with contextual prompt generation
- ✅ Implement response quality evaluation and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Add comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies
- ✅ Provide helper functions for easy workflow execution

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Complete - 100%

## Progress Log

### July 30, 2025
- Created complete query workflow implementation in `src/workflows/query_workflow.py`
- Implemented all 13 workflow steps with comprehensive state management
- Added query intent analysis supporting 5 different intent types (code search, documentation, explanation, debugging, architecture)
- Implemented 4 search strategies (semantic, hybrid, metadata-filtered, keyword)
- Integrated with existing vector store factory for retrieval operations
- Added LLM integration with contextual prompt generation based on query intent
- Implemented response quality evaluation using heuristic scoring
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific handlers for retrieval and LLM errors
- Implemented fallback strategies including search parameter expansion and retry mechanisms
- Added required abstract methods (define_steps, execute_step, validate_state) for BaseWorkflow compatibility
- Created helper function `execute_query` for simplified workflow execution
- Fixed state access patterns to use dictionary notation consistent with existing codebase
- Updated todo-list.md to mark Task 2.3 as completed
- Updated memory bank task tracking to reflect completion

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Complete adaptive RAG query processing pipeline
- Stateful workflow with progress tracking
- Query intent analysis and adaptive search strategies
- Context sufficiency checking with automatic expansion
- Response quality control with retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- Integration with existing LangChain components
- Helper functions for easy workflow execution

**Technical Achievements:**
- 600+ lines of production-ready code
- Integration with vector store factory, LLM factory, and embedding factory
- Proper TypedDict state management following project patterns
- Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- Quality control mechanisms with automatic retry logic
- Extensible design supporting future enhancements

The query workflow is now complete and ready to handle user queries through the adaptive RAG processing pipeline, providing high-quality responses with proper source attribution and error recovery.
