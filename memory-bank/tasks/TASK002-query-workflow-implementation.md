# [TASK002] - Query Workflow Implementation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** July 30, 2025  
**Updated:** July 30, 2025  

## Original Request
Complete Task 2.3: LangGraph Query Workflow Implementation from the todo-list.md. Implement a complete stateful query workflow using LangGraph for adaptive RAG query processing with quality control and fallback mechanisms.

## Thought Process
The query workflow is the counterpart to the indexing workflow, handling user queries through an adaptive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) processing pipeline. Key considerations:

1. **State Management**: Following the same patterns as the indexing workflow, using TypedDict schemas and dictionary access
2. **Adaptive Processing**: Implementing query intent analysis, search strategy selection, and response quality control
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies for retrieval and LLM failures
4. **LangChain Integration**: Proper integration with existing vector stores, embeddings, and LLM factories
5. **Quality Control**: Response quality evaluation and retry mechanisms for improved results

## Implementation Plan
- ✅ Create `src/workflows/query_workflow.py` with QueryWorkflow class extending BaseWorkflow
- ✅ Implement query processing steps: Parse → Validate → Analyze Intent → Search → Generate Response
- ✅ Add search strategy determination based on query intent (code search, documentation, debugging, etc.)
- ✅ Implement vector search with metadata filtering and adaptive parameters
- ✅ Add context sufficiency checking and search expansion when needed
- ✅ Integrate LLM calling with contextual prompt generation
- ✅ Implement response quality evaluation and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Add comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies
- ✅ Provide helper functions for easy workflow execution

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Complete - 100% (Including Tasks 2.4 & 2.5 from Todo List)
