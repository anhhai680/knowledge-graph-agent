# [TASK011] - Neo4j Graph Serialization Fix

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** August 5, 2025  
**Updated:** August 5, 2025

## Original Request
"Your changes has introduced the new issue as error logs below. Unable to serialize unknown type: <class 'neo4j.graph.Node'>"

User reported a Neo4j serialization error occurring in the graph query API endpoint where FastAPI couldn't serialize Neo4j Node objects returned from MemGraph queries.

## Thought Process
The error indicated that the FastAPI JSON serialization was failing when trying to convert Neo4j Node objects directly to JSON. This is a common issue when working with graph databases - the native Neo4j objects contain complex internal structures that aren't directly JSON serializable.

The problem was in the `execute_query` method of MemGraphStore where we were using:
```python
data = [dict(record) for record in result]
```

This approach doesn't properly handle Neo4j Node, Relationship, and Path objects which need special serialization.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Add Neo4j graph object imports (Node, Relationship, Path)
- [x] Create helper functions for serializing Neo4j objects to JSON-safe dictionaries
- [x] Update the execute_query method to use proper serialization
- [x] Test the fix with real graph queries
- [x] Verify no regression in functionality

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### August 5, 2025
- Identified root cause: Neo4j Node objects not being properly serialized in API responses
- Added Neo4j graph object imports to MemGraphStore
- Implemented `_serialize_neo4j_object()` helper function that handles:
  - Neo4j Node objects → {id, labels, properties}
  - Neo4j Relationship objects → {id, type, start_node, end_node, properties}
  - Neo4j Path objects → {nodes, relationships, length}
  - Regular objects → pass-through unchanged
- Implemented `_serialize_record()` helper to process entire records
- Updated `execute_query` method to use new serialization
- Tested with multiple graph query patterns - all working correctly
- Verified no more "Unable to serialize unknown type" errors in Docker logs
- Confirmed 200 OK responses instead of previous 500 Internal Server Errors

## Technical Implementation Details

### Helper Functions Added:
```python
def _serialize_neo4j_object(obj):
    """Convert Neo4j objects to serializable dictionaries."""
    
def _serialize_record(record):
    """Convert a Neo4j record to a serializable dictionary."""
```

### Key Change:
```python
# Before (broken)
data = [dict(record) for record in result]

# After (working)  
data = [_serialize_record(record) for record in result]
```

### Test Results:
- Graph queries returning nodes: ✅ Working
- Graph queries returning properties: ✅ Working  
- Graph queries returning counts: ✅ Working
- Complex nested queries: ✅ Working
- API JSON serialization: ✅ Working

## Resolution Summary
Successfully resolved the Neo4j serialization issue that was causing 500 errors in the graph query API endpoint. The fix ensures all graph query responses are properly serialized to JSON while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility. The solution is robust and handles all Neo4j object types (Node, Relationship, Path) appropriately.
